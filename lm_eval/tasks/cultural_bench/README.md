Title: CulturalBench: a Robust, Diverse and Challenging Benchmark on Measuring the (Lack of) Cultural Knowledge of LLMs

Abstract: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02677

CulturalBench is a set of 1,227 human-written and human-verified questions for effectively assessing LLMsâ€™ cultural knowledge, covering 45 global regions including the underrepresented ones like Bangladesh, Zimbabwe, and Peru.

We evaluate models on two setups: CulturalBench-Easy and CulturalBench-Hard which share the same questions but asked differently.

- CulturalBench-Easy: multiple-choice questions (Output: one out of four options i.e. A,B,C,D). Evaluate model accuracy at question level (i.e. per question_idx). There are 1,227 questions in total.
- CulturalBench-Hard: binary (Output: one out of two possibilties i.e. True/False). Evaluate model accuracy at question level (i.e. per question_idx). There are 1,227x4=4908 binary judgements in total with 1,227 questions provided.

### Checklist

For adding novel benchmarks/datasets to the library:

* [ ] Is the task an existing benchmark in the literature?
  * [ ] Have you referenced the original paper that introduced the task?
  * [ ] If yes, does the original paper provide a reference implementation? If so, have you checked against the reference implementation and documented how to run such a test?

If other tasks on this dataset are already supported:

* [ ] Is the "Main" variant of this task clearly denoted?
* [ ] Have you provided a short sentence in a README on what each new variant adds / evaluates?
* [ ] Have you noted which, if any, published evaluation setups are matched by this variant?
